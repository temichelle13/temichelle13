## 🌟Student at Walden University🌟
# 🎓Bachelor of Science in Business Administration - Accelerate into Master's

My overall goal is to start learning new skills, gain insight, and enhance my portfolio. I'm trying to ensure I learn the correct methods through practice and application while also discovering new concepts or interests. I am hoping to increase productivity, gain experiance, develop new skills, and expand my knowledge. I'm just trying to be the ebst verison of myself that I can be. 
    I'm also not sure what I should be putting in this readme, so i'm just guessing for now and I'll modify it as I learn more. Or maybe I won't 🤣🤷‍♀️
