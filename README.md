## 🌟Student at Walden University🌟 
### 🎓Bachelor of Science in Business Administration 
My goal is to learn new skills, gain insight, and enhance my portfolio. I'm trying to learn the correct methods through practice and application while discovering new concepts or interests. I hope to increase productivity, gain experience, develop new skills, and expand my knowledge. I'm just trying to be the best version of myself that I can be. 
    I'm also unsure what to put in this readme, so I'm just guessing for now, and I'll modify it as I learn more. Or maybe I won't 🤣🤷‍♀️
